<h3>Finding love</h3>

<pre class="f9 b9 big">
Chorus  Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
  And young affection gapes to be his heir;
  That fair for which <span class="b5"><span class="bold">love</span></span> groan'd for and would die,
  With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
  Now Romeo is be<span class="b5"><span class="bold">love</span></span>d and <span class="b5"><span class="bold">love</span></span>s again,
  Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
  But to his foe supposed he must complain,
  And she steal <span class="b5"><span class="bold">love</span></span>'s sweet bait from fearful hooks:
  Being held a foe, he may not have access
  To breathe such vows as <span class="b5"><span class="bold">love</span></span>rs use to swear;
  And she as much in <span class="b5"><span class="bold">love</span></span>, her means much less
  To meet her new-be<span class="b5"><span class="bold">love</span></span>d any where:
  But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
  Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
</pre>
