<h3>Finding love</h3>

<pre class="f9 b9 big">

Chorus  Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
  And young affection gapes to be his heir;
  That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
  With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
  Now Romeo is <span class="b5"><span class="bold">beloved</span></span> and loves again,
  Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
  But to his foe supposed he must complain,
  And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
  Being held a foe, he may not have access
  To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
  And she as much in love, her means much less
  To meet her new-<span class="b5"><span class="bold">beloved</span></span> any where:
  But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
  Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
