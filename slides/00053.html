Chorus  Now old desire doth in his death-bed <span class="b5"><span class="bold">lie</span></span>,
  And young affection gapes to be his heir;
  That fair for which <span class="b5"><span class="bold">love</span></span> groan'd for and would die,
  With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
  Now Romeo is beloved and <span class="b5"><span class="bold">loves</span></span> again,
  Alike betwitched by the charm of <span class="b5"><span class="bold">looks</span></span>,
  But to his foe supposed he must complain,
  And she steal <span class="b5"><span class="bold">love</span></span>'s sweet bait from fearful hooks:
  Being held a foe, he may not have access
  To breathe such vows as <span class="b5"><span class="bold">lovers</span></span> use to swear;
  And she as much in <span class="b5"><span class="bold">love</span></span>, her means much <span class="b5"><span class="bold">less</span></span>
  To meet her new-beloved any where:
  But passion <span class="b5"><span class="bold">lends</span></span> them power, time means, to meet
  Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
