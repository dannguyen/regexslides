<pre class="f9 b9 big">
Chorus  Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
  And young affection gapes to be his heir;
  That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
  With tender Juliet match'd, is now not <span class="b5"><span class="bold">fair.</span></span>
  Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
  Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
  But to his foe supposed he must complain,
  And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
  Being held a foe, he may not have access
  To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
  And she as much in love, her means much less
  To meet her new-beloved any where:
  But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
  Tempering extremities with extreme <span class="b5"><span class="bold">sweet.</span></span>
