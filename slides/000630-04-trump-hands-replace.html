<p class="excerpt"><span class="b5"><span class="bold">A Man With The Best Hands</span></span> MAY have bullied his way into the center of the American political arena, but during his Super Tuesday victory speech last week, the real action took place in the margins. That's where you could find Chris Christie apparently lost in reverie, his bewildering expressions instantly stealing the spotlight from <span class="b5"><span class="bold">A Man With The Best Hands</span></span>'s choreographed Main Event. Twitter exploded with interpretations. Was he being held hostage? Realizing he had made a Gob Bluth-like "huge mistake"? Experiencing all the stages of grief simultaneously? Suddenly, <span class="b5"><span class="bold">A Man With The Best Hands</span></span> was only the nation's second-most-compelling political psychodrama. Within minutes, Viners had re-cut the video, editing <span class="b5"><span class="bold">A Man With The Best Hands</span></span> out of the frame entirely and zooming in on Christie's face. The supporting player had become the star.</p>
